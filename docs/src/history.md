We present the RENEC blockchain, designed with scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability as fundamental principles, to address these challenges. RENEC is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to enable creators to build experiences provided to the billion users in the Web3 era. Founded in 2021, RENEC blockchain is an open-source project currently run by the RENEC foundation. RENECâ€™s third-generation blockchain architecture is designed to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized application (DApp) creation. The RENEC genesis occurred on October 14, 2022. RENEC aims to scale throughput beyond what is typically achieved by popular blockchains while keeping costs low.

The RENEC vision is to deliver a blockchain that can bring mainstream adoption to web3 and empower an ecosystem of decentralized applications to solve real-world user problems. Our mission is to advance the state-of-the-art in blockchain reliability, safety, and performance by providing a flexible and modular blockchain architecture. This architecture should support frequent upgrades, fast adoption of the latest technology advancements, and first-class support for new and emerging use cases.

We envision a decentralized, secure, and scalable network governed and operated by the community that uses it. When infrastructure demands grow across the world, the computational resources of the blockchain scale up horizontally and vertically to meet those needs. As new use cases and technological advances arise, the network should frequently and seamlessly upgrade without interrupting users.
